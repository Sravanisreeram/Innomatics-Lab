Step - 2: Train different Machine Learning models:

Logistic Regression

SVM with Linear Kernel

SVM with RBF Kernel

Decision Tree

KNN

Step - 3: Performed proper hyperparameter tuning for each model from Step - 2 ðŸ˜¢

Step - 4: Compared all the models and written my observations i.e. why is one model better than the other?

Added this observation at the end of my jupyter notebook
